We then gather these crucial points for a\\nvariety of𝑑 and show that this relationship can be modeled empirically with a polynomial function.\\nWe also go one step further and construct a realistic but simple dataset based on these theoret-\\nical limitations (called LIMIT). Despite the simplicity of the task (e.g.,who likes Apples? and\\nJon likes Apples, ...), we find it is very difficult for even state-of-the-art embedding mod-\\nels [Lee et al., 2025, Zhang et al., 2025] on MTEB [Enevoldsen et al., 2025] due to the theoretical\\nunderpinnings, and impossible1 for models with small embedding dimensions.\\nOverall, our work contributes: (1) a theoretical basis for the fundamental limitations of embedding\\nmodels, (2) a best-case empirical analysis showing that this proof holds for any dataset instantiation\\n(by free embedding optimization), and (3) a simple real-world natural language instantiation called\\nLIMIT that even state-of-the-art embedding models cannot solve.\\nThese results imply interesting findings for the community: on one hand we see neural embedding\\nmodels becoming immensely successful. However, academic benchmarks test only a small amount of\\nthe queries that could be issued (and these queries are often overfitted to), hiding these limitations.\\nOur work shows that as the tasks given to embedding models require returning ever-increasing\\ncombinations of top-𝑘relevant documents (e.g., through instructions connecting previously unrelated\\n1At least with current optimization techniques for retrieval.\\n2', 'On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval\\ndocuments with logical operators), we will reach a limit of combinations they cannot represent.\\nThus, the community should be aware of these limitations, both when designing evaluations (as\\nLIMITshows)andbychoosingalternativeretrievalapproaches–suchascross-encoders ormulti-vector\\nmodels – when attempting to create models that can handle the full range of instruction-based queries,\\ni.e. any query and relevance definition.\\n2.

Thesenewbenchmarks\\npush embeddings to work forany queryand any notion of relevancethat could be given. While prior\\nworks have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings, there is a common assumption\\nthat these difficulties are exclusively due to unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome\\nwith better training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may encounter these\\ntheoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely simple queries. We connect known results\\nin learning theory, showing that the number of top-𝑘 subsets of documents capable of being returned\\nas the result of some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show that\\nthis holds true even if we restrict to𝑘 = 2, and directly optimize on the test set with free parameterized\\nembeddings. We then create a realistic dataset called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these\\ntheoretical results, and observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the simple\\nnature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under the existing single vector\\nparadigm and calls for future research to develop methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.\\n1.

It not only significantly outperforms dot-product based\\nbaselines in hit rate, but also better generalizes to torso and long\\ntail where there are limited training examples by utilizing gating\\ndesigns and component-level hypersphere embeddings.\\nOur second contribution is to enable efficient training and in-\\nference with expressive similarity functions (e.g., MoL), on modern\\naccelerators (Section 4). We propose a hierarchical retrieval strat-\\negy, and in particular, an accelerator-friendly algorithm for very\\nlarge corpus called h-indexer. Combined with other optimizations\\nlike quantization and kernel fusions, h-indexer enables us to scale\\nup retrieval to hundreds of millions of items with latency compa-\\nrable to MIPS setups. It’s worth remarking that, as highlighted in\\nFigure 2, the serving cost, e.g., latency and throughput — on GPUs\\nin this work — does not necessarily increase with compute thanks\\nto the significantly higher GPU utilization of our model. Our hier-\\narchical design, unlike dot-product, can also harness more compute\\nwith constant GPU memory budget, which is critical given limited\\nmemory capacity in production.\\nOur final contribution is to conduct extensive experiments on\\npublic and industrial datasets (Section 5) with MoL and h-indexer.\\nOur proposed method achieves up to 77.3% gain in HR on standard\\nbenchmark datasets like MovieLens and Amazon Reviews, and up\\nto +27.6% gain at HR@50 over strong baselines on one of the largest\\nrecommendation system deployments at Meta. The strong perfor-\\nmance of MoL validates our hypothesis that expressive similarity\\nfunctions are needed to capture dynamics of real-world datasets at\\nretrieval stage. The proposed method also reduces Matthew effect,\\nshowing that MoL indeed generalizes well over the entire corpus.\\nWe finally compare the proposed approach with related works\\nin Section 6 and conclude in Section 7.\\n2 OVERVIEW'}\n",

Thesenewbenchmarks\\npush embeddings to work forany queryand any notion of relevancethat could be given. While prior\\nworks have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings, there is a common assumption\\nthat these difficulties are exclusively due to unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome\\nwith better training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may encounter these\\ntheoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely simple queries. We connect known results\\nin learning theory, showing that the number of top-𝑘 subsets of documents capable of being returned\\nas the result of some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show that\\nthis holds true even if we restrict to𝑘 = 2, and directly optimize on the test set with free parameterized\\nembeddings. We then create a realistic dataset called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these\\ntheoretical results, and observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the simple\\nnature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under the existing single vector\\nparadigm and calls for future research to develop methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.\\n1.

It not only significantly outperforms dot-product based\\nbaselines in hit rate, but also better generalizes to torso and long\\ntail where there are limited training examples by utilizing gating\\ndesigns and component-level hypersphere embeddings.\\nOur second contribution is to enable efficient training and in-\\nference with expressive similarity functions (e.g., MoL), on modern\\naccelerators (Section 4). We propose a hierarchical retrieval strat-\\negy, and in particular, an accelerator-friendly algorithm for very\\nlarge corpus called h-indexer.

It’s worth remarking that, as highlighted in\\nFigure 2, the serving cost, e.g., latency and throughput — on GPUs\\nin this work — does not necessarily increase with compute thanks\\nto the significantly higher GPU utilization of our model. Our hier-\\narchical design, unlike dot-product, can also harness more compute\\nwith constant GPU memory budget, which is critical given limited\\nmemory capacity in production.\\nOur final contribution is to conduct extensive experiments on\\npublic and industrial datasets (Section 5) with MoL and h-indexer.\\nOur proposed method achieves up to 77.3% gain in HR on standard\\nbenchmark datasets like MovieLens and Amazon Reviews, and up\\nto +27.6% gain at HR@50 over strong baselines on one of the largest\\nrecommendation system deployments at Meta. The strong perfor-\\nmance of MoL validates our hypothesis that expressive similarity\\nfunctions are needed to capture dynamics of real-world datasets at\\nretrieval stage.
