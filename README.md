### Exp-1: Chunking and Retrieval Experiment
- Explores chunking data, generating embeddings, and performing retrieval tasks. Includes scripts and a Jupyter notebook for experimentation.

### Exp-2: Knowledge Distillation on MNIST
- Implements knowledge distillation on the MNIST dataset to transfer knowledge from a large model to a smaller one.

### Exp-3: Subliminal Learning and Entanglement
- Investigates concepts of subliminal learning and entanglement through theoretical and experimental approaches.([Baulabs](https://baulab.info/) study replication)

### Exp-4: Adam Optimizer Study
- Analyzes the Adam optimizer's behavior and performance in machine learning tasks.
